# Story 014 â€“ Empty States & Progress

## Goal

Improve empty/error states and show per-item in-flight indicators.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Friendly empty state with guidance to add first item.
- Error state with retry action.
- Per-item progress during toggle/edit/delete (e.g., spinner overlay or opacity).

## UI Notes

- Reuse MUI Alert for error; add an inline Retry button.
- Consider subtle animation for item state changes.
